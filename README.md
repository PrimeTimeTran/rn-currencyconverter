# Week 2 - **Currency üíµüí¥üí∂üí∑ Converter**

## Introduction üåü

Let's build a new app üì± using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) & [Expo](https://expo.io/).  Our app will help users convert currency üíµ from USD üá∫üá≤ to VND üáªüá≥.

### Features üéØ ü•Öü•áüèÜ

- [ ] User sees instructions advising them what to do.
- [ ] User can input data to our application via a `TextInput`.
- [ ] User can see a placeholder text in the input indicating an expected value to be entered by the user.
- [ ] User can only enter numbers into the input.
- [ ] User can see centered text in the input.
- [ ] User can see two buttons indicating:
  - VND to USD
  - USD to VND
- [ ] User can see a prompt showing the current value they've entered.
- [ ] User can see a prompt showing the current value's converted value.
- [ ] User can see both values formatted correctly for the currencies region.
- [ ] User can switch from VND to USD or USD to VND.

### Learning Objectives ‚úçÔ∏èüìöüìù üìàüôå Ô∏è

1. Learn more about passing props.
    - Recognize we can pass many different props to components. These props can be of many different datatypes üçöü•¶üçóüå∂. Types include `String`, `Boolean`, `Object`, and, `Function`.
2. Learn how to build our own components which consume props.
    - Recognize that the components we get for free from libraries üìö work just like the ones we build üë∑üèóÔ∏èüè≠.

3. Learn how to compose our functional components with internal functions.
    - Recognize that a well written üìù‚öñÔ∏è component is composed of many smaller parts which encapsulate logic. These parts all work together ‚ôªÔ∏è.

4. Learn how to [useState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) in our applications.
    - Recognize that stateful applications are how we add dynamic üîÄ & engaging üå† behavior.

5. Learn that we can have our code watch üîç for user events within our components ‚öôÔ∏è.
    - Recognize that we need to listen for key user üë®‚Äçüíª events üì∏. `TouchableOpacity` and the prop `onPress` will be an important one.

> **Tip** üí°: As we move forward we'll have smaller and smaller code snippets. We do this to encourage you to think about what the code does and where it is it needs to go.

### **Milestone 1 üõ£üèÉ Get up and running**

Create a new application using what we learned last week. This knowledge gives us a **sky üõ´üå§Ô∏è** of possibilities.

**A)**  Use `expo init currencyConvert` to generate a new project. Remember, it contains many folders üìÇ and files üìë. Afterwards start the simulator. 

![pwd](./assets/1a.png)

**B)** Edit the placeholder for `App` to add some instructions for the user on how to use our app.  

```jsx
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Please enter the value of the currency you want to convert</Text>
    </View>
  );
```

![pwd](./assets/1b.png)

**C)** Now let's add a `TextInput` to the same `View`, so the user can input the amount of currency they'll need to change. Don't forget to import `TextInput` at the top of `App.js`. We'll add the `TextInput` below the instruction text from the previous sub-step.

```jsx
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text>
    Please enter the value of the currency you want to convert
  </Text>
  <TextInput />
</View>
```

![pwd](./assets/1c.png)

#### Different Styles üíãüëî‚å®

If a component contains no children you can close them with a `/>`.

<details>

<summary>Non self closing</summary>

```jsx
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text>Please enter the value of the currency you want to convert</Text>
  <TextInput></TextInput>
</View>
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Self closing</summary>

```jsx
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text>Please enter the value of the currency you want to convert</Text>
  <TextInput />
</View>
```

</details>

We nested the `TextInput` inside of the `View` below the `Text`, but we don't see anything. That's because we need to add a **prop** to the `TextInput` component.

**E)** Pass a style üíÖ prop.

```jsx
<TextInput
  style={{
    height: 60,
    padding: 5,
    width: 300,
    fontSize: 35,
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: 'lightblue'
  }}
/>
```

![name](./assets/1d.png)

**F)** Now enable your simulator's **Keyboard**.

![name](./assets/1e.png)

> **Tip** üí°: We need to account for the keyboard in the layout when building for mobile. Failing to do this can be deadly ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùóüö´.

**G)** Everything's bunched at the bottom. There's a lot of wasted space at the top. Move everything toward the top by updating the styles at the bottom of the file.

```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    marginTop: 50,	
    alignItems: 'center',	
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
  },
});
```

Here we're using flexbox to position things. Learn more [here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/j/justify-content/). Here's a more [detailed explanation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content).

![name](./assets/1f.png)
Everything starts at the top of the screen now. Nice.

**H)** Since were building a currency converter, it would be appropriate that the user should only be able to enter numbers. Pass the `TextInput` a new prop which makes the keyboard numpad type. You can find all the keyboard types documented at [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput#keyboardtype](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput#keyboardtype). 

<details>
```jsx
<TextInput
  keyboardType="number-pad"
/>
```
</details>

![name](./assets/1g.png)


**I)** Last polish step: right now our user must tap on the text input when they first open the app. Let's make that automatic for our users by adding the [autoFocus prop](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput#autofocus). 

```jsx
<TextInput
  autoFocus={true}
/>
```

![name](./assets/1h.png)
We should now see the `TextInput` focus immediately. The keyboard should also reveal.

**J)** Center the text in the input so it looks better.

```jsx
<TextInput
  textAlign="center"
/>
```

![name](./assets/1i.png)

**K)** Let's add a `placeholder` **prop** as well to be super explicit to the user on our expectations.

```jsx
<TextInput
  placeholder="100,000,000 VND"
/>
```

![name](./assets/1j.png)

**L)** Choose a custom color for the cursor. Add the prop `selectionColor`.

```jsx
<TextInput
  selectionColor="red"
/>
```

![name](./assets/1k.png)
If your screen looks like this then good work. We indicated to the user what we want. We've also made some sensible decisions in terms of user experience. The `TextInput` component is auto focused, the keyboard is of type `Number`, the placeholder is a value which shows an appropriate input.

All of this is the result of the props we passed to `TextInput`.

```jsx
<TextInput
  autoFocus
  textAlign="center"
  selectionColor="red"
  keyboardType="number-pad"
  placeholder="100,000,000 VND"
  // more to come!
/>
```

---
> Key Points üîëüìù

- There is a `TextInput` component provided from React Native.
- There are many different properties we can pass `TextInput`. The properties can be of datatype `String`, `Boolean`, `Object`, and spoiler, `Function`.

---

### **Milestone 2 üõ£üèÉ Complete layout by creating our own component**

Let's create a component which highlights the **from** and **to** currencies. It will also handle the user choosing between which currencies to convert. I advise we create a component because we want to **reuse the logic which handle this behavior** for **multiple conversion types**.

**A)** Import a `TouchableOpacity` component from React Native, which is a slightly more advanced version of a `Button`.

```jsx
import {
  TouchableOpacity,
} from 'react-native'
```

**B)** Let's go ahead and add some style to the `TouchableOpacity` component.

```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  button: {
    height: 35,
    width: 200,
    margin: 10,
    borderWidth: 2,
    borderRadius: 20,
    alignItems: 'center',
    borderColor: 'lightblue',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  }
})
```

**C)** Now define the component above the `App` component.

```jsx
const ConversionTypeButton = () => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>  
      <Text>VND to USD</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )
}
```

**D)** Nest the `ConversionTypeButton` component in the body of our `App` components body.

```jsx
return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <ConversionTypeButton />
    </View>
  )
```

![name](./assets/2a.png)
We can see a VND to USD button now. This one will handle VND to USD conversion for the user. Now we need to do the same thing for USD to VND. Nest another `ConversionTypeButton` component in the body of the return.

**E)** Add a second `ConversionTypeButton` for USD to VND

```jsx
return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <ConversionTypeButton />
      <ConversionTypeButton />
    </View>
  )
```

![name](./assets/2d.png)
We have two buttons but we have a problem ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùóüö´. The buttons say the **exact same thing**. That's not what we want.

#### How can we fix this?

We can fix this by applying a concept we learned last week. We can pass props to our component.

**D)** Pass two new props `from` & `to` to our `ConversionTypeButton` component when we nest it in the body of `App`. Contemplate  the value of these properties.

#### How are they the same. How are they different?

```jsx
return (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <ConversionTypeButton
      to="usd"
      from="vnd"
    />
    <ConversionTypeButton
      to="vnd"
      from="usd"
    />
  </View>
)
```

Now we've got two props passed to our `ConversionTypeButton`. That isn't enough though. The component needs to be smarter.

**E)** Refactor `ConversionTypeButton` to behave correctly based on these new props, `to` & `from`.

The result is the component rendering the appropriate flags based on the props sent to it.

```jsx
const ConversionTypeButton = (props) => {
  const fromFlag = props.from === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá≤' : 'üáªüá≥'
  const toFlag = props.to === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá≤' : 'üáªüá≥'
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>
      <Text>{fromFlag} to {toFlag}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )
}
```

![name](./assets/2e.png)
We should now see our buttons render with the appropriate flags. Nice.

#### Different Styles üíãüëî‚å®

Here's a couple different ways we could have refactored `<ConversionTypeButton />`. The `if` conditional means we dont repeat the ternary. However, we have to define  the `toFlag` and `fromFlag` twice. Which one do you like and why?

<details>

<summary>Option 1</summary>

```jsx
const ConversionTypeButton = ({ from, to }) => {
  const fromFlag = from === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá≤' : 'üáªüá≥'
  const toFlag = to === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá≤' : 'üáªüá≥'
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>
      <Text>{fromFlag} to {toFlag}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )
}
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Option 2</summary>

```jsx
const ConversionTypeButton = ({ from, to }) => {
  let toFlag
  let fromFlag

  if (from === 'usd') {
    toFlag = 'üáªüá≥'
    fromFlag = 'üá∫üá≤'
  } else {
    toFlag = 'üá∫üá≤'
    fromFlag = 'üáªüá≥'
  }

  return (
    <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>
      <Text>{fromFlag} to {toFlag}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )
}
```

</details>

**F)** Add the two prompts and values below what we have so far.

We need to help the user understand what the input and conversion values are as well as which is which. This is how they'll know which number represents which value, `from` or `to`.

1. First lets add a new style to the bottom.

```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  currencyText: {
    fontSize: 30,
    color: 'green',
    fontWeight: 'bold'
  }
})

```

2. Now let's add some components & styles of the correct composition to the body of the return from `App`.

```jsx
return (
  <View>
    <Text>
      Current currency:
    </Text>
    <Text style={styles.currencyText}>
      0.00
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Conversion currenecy:
    </Text>
    <Text style={styles.currencyText}>
      0.00
    </Text>
  </View>
)
```

![name](./assets/2f.png)

We should see the two prompts above the two `from` & `to` now.

---
> Key Points üîëüìù

- `TextInput` & `TouchableOpacity` aree components provided for free. We will use them often. `TextInput` & `TouchableOpacity` take a `style` prop like most components we'll use.

- Creating components help us reuse logic. Consider the `ConversionTypeButton` component we created.

- We can pass our components props like we did for `TextInput` & `TouchableOpacity`. Consider the `from` and `to` props we passed to `ConversionTypeButton`.

- The props given to a component determine how the components will behave. Contemplate how `ConversionTypeButton` shows different flags becaused of the different props.

---

### **Milestone 3 üõ£üèÉ Add statefulness to our application to implement behavior**

One of the most important concepts in React is state. There have been many ways to handle state developed over the years. We'll use [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) in our class.

State will allow us to encapsulate logic into our applications from whether or not a user is signed in, if we have movies to show, or what currency a user wants to convert `from` & `to`.

State can represent anything we can imagine.

**A)** Add a new piece of state to the app, `currentCurrencyValue`.

1. Grab two new dependencies from React, `useState` & `useEffect`. These two functions are introduced to handle state.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
```

2. Use state in the body of the `App` component's definition. Call the function `useState` with an argument of `0`.

    - The return value of this function call is an array.
    - We need the first two items in the array, `currentCurrencyValue` & `setFromCurrencyValue`.
    - The `0` is the initial value of `currentCurrencyValue`.
    - `setFromCurrencyValue` is how we'll update the variable.

#### This is how we'll get access state in our app. We define the name of the `variable`, the `initial value`, and the `setter` method in one line. This all comes from a function call to `useState`

```jsx
const [currentCurrencyValue, setFromCurrencyValue] = useState(0)
```

3. Add the `currentCurrencyValue` variable we just got from the `useState` function call to our return.

```jsx
<Text style={styles.currencyText}>
  {currentCurrencyValue}
</Text>
```

![name](./assets/3a.png)

You should now see a `0` underneath 'Current currency'

**B)** Implement current currency updating.


Pass as a new property to our `TextInput` component. The value is the second index value from the array we get from `useState`.

```jsx
<TextInput
  onChangeText={setFromCurrencyValue}
>
```

![name](./assets/3b.png)

We should now see that the current currency value follows that of the `TextInput`.

**C)** We need to do the same thing for the converted currencies value. Follow the same steps to have access to a new piece of state. We'll call this variable `convertedCurrencyValue`.

```jsx
const [convertedCurrencyValue, setConvertedValue] = useState(0)
```

```jsx
<Text style={styles.currencyText}>
  {convertedCurrencyValue}
</Text>
```

![name](./assets/3c.png)
We should now see a `0` underneath 'Convesion Currency'. However, if you look closely, when the user enters 100,000 VND, the converted currency value does not change.

**D)** Implement converted currency behaving as expected from VND to USD.

1. Define a new function, `convertCurrency`, in the body of our `App` component.

This function will look at the state of our app, specifically the 
`currentCurrencyValue` value, then decide by 23000. This is the calculation to convert from VND to USD.

```jsx
const convertCurrency = () => {
  setConvertedValue(currentCurrencyValue / 23000)
}
```

2. Use the `useEffect` hook provided by React in `App`'s body as well. Pass it the function we want to run in the event of a state change, the one we just defined, `convertCurrency`.

```jsx
useEffect(convertCurrency)
```

![name](./assets/3d.png)

We should now see that the current and conversion values change.

---
> Key Points üîëüìù

- We will represent real world concepts in our apps using `state`.
- We can access state in React via a call to the function `useState`.
- The argument to `useState`'s call is the initial value of the variable.
- The return value of `useState` is an array. The first index of the array is the variable we get, the second is the `setter` function.

---

### **Milestone 4 üõ£üèÉ Implement final requirements**
Lets get the currency formatted, button highlighted if it's the current conversion type, and flags showing

**A)** Add two new pieces of state, `toCurrency` & `fromCurrency`. These values will represent which currencies the user wants to exchange `from` & `to` respectively.

```jsx
const [toCurrency, setToCurrency] = useState('usd')
const [fromCurrency, setFromCurrency] = useState('vnd')
```

**B)** Define a new function which will handle the user changing the conversion they want to make.

```jsx
const setConversionCurrencies = (from, to) => {
  setFromCurrency(from)
  setToCurrency(to)
}
```

**C)** Pass these values to our `ConversionTypeButton` component as props.

```jsx
<ConversionTypeButton
  toCurrency={toCurrency}
  fromCurrency={fromCurrency}
  setConversionCurrencies={setConversionCurrencies}
/>
```

**D)** Refactor our `ConversionTypeButton` component. Implement it to look at the `fromCurrency` and `toCurrency` props passed to it and to behave accordingly.

1. Style button based on comparsions of it's `to` & `from` props to it's `fromCurrency` and `toCurrency` props. This will result in the button having a blue background if it's conversion type is that of the current state.

2. Pass the style, `buttonStyle`, as the second element in an array passed to the `style` prop of `TouchableOpacity`.

3. Forward the `setConversionCurrencies` prop we sent to `ConversionTypeButton` as a prop to it's `onPress`. This will allow to use to change which conversion they want to make. We also need to pass this function call two arguments, `from` & `to`.

```jsx
const ConversionTypeButton = (props) => {
  const backgroundColor = props.fromCurrency === props.from && props.toCurrency === props.to ? 'lightblue' : null
  const buttonStyle = { backgroundColor: backgroundColor  }

  const fromFlag = props.from === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá∏' : 'üáªüá≥'
  const toFlag = props.to === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá∏' : 'üáªüá≥'

  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      style={[styles.button, buttonStyle]}
      onPress={() => props.setConversionCurrencies(props.from, props.to)}
    >
      <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{fromFlag} to {toFlag}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )
}
```

#### Different Styles üíãüëî‚å®

ES6 destructuring is the authors preferred method of writing this code.

<details>

<summary>Better</summary>

```jsx
const ConversionTypeButton = ({ fromCurrency, toCurrency, from, to, setConversionCurrencies}) => {
  const backgroundColor = fromCurrency === from && toCurrency === to ? 'lightblue' : null
  const buttonStyle = { backgroundColor: backgroundColor  }

  const fromFlag = from === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá∏' : 'üáªüá≥'
  const toFlag = to === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá∏' : 'üáªüá≥'

  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      style={[styles.button, buttonStyle]}
      onPress={() => setConversionCurrencies(from, to)}
    >
      <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{fromFlag} to {toFlag}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )
}
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Best</summary>

```jsx
const ConversionTypeButton = ({
  to,
  from,
  toCurrency,
  fromCurrency,
  setConversionCurrencies,
}) => {
  const isSelectedConversionType = fromCurrency === from && toCurrency === to
  const backgroundColor = isSelectedConversionType ? 'lightblue' : null
  const conditionalButtonStyle = { backgroundColor }

  const fromFlag = from === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá∏' : 'üáªüá≥'
  const toFlag = to === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá∏' : 'üáªüá≥'

  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      style={[styles.button, conditionalButtonStyle]}
      onPress={() => setConversionCurrencies(from, to)}
    >
      <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{fromFlag} to {toFlag}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  )
}
```

</details>

**E)** Refactor our `convertCurrency` function to behave according to the current state of the applications `fromCurrency` value. If the `fromCurrency` is VND we divide by 23,000, else, we multiply by 23,000. Computer Science!

Afterwards, we call the function we got for free `setConvertedValue` with the argument of the new converted currenciees value.

```jsx
const convertCurrency = () => {
  let value
  if (fromCurrency === 'vnd') {
    value = currentCurrencyValue / 23000
  } else {
    value =  23000 * currentCurrencyValue
  }
  setConvertedValue(value)
}
```

![name](./assets/4e.gif)
The app should behave like this now.

**F)** Add appropriate formatting for currency.

Create a new component `FormattedCurrency`. Contemplate the data this component needs and how it should both get & consume it for a moment before moving on.

```jsx
const FormattedCurrency = (props) => {
  const format = props.type === 'usd' ? 'us' : 'vn'
  const currency = props.type === 'usd' ? 'USD' : 'VND'
  const flag = props.type === 'usd' ? 'üá∫üá∏' : 'üáªüá≥'

  const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat(format, {
    currency,
    style: 'currency',
  });

  return (
    <Text style={styles.currencyText}>
      {formatter.format(props.value)} {flag}
    </Text>
  )
}
```

**G)** Add `FormattedCurrency` to the body of `App`'s return.

```jsx
<Text>
  Current currency:
</Text>
<FormattedCurrency
  type={fromCurrency}
  value={currentCurrencyValue}
/>
<Text>
  Conversion currenecy:
</Text>
<FormattedCurrency
  type={toCurrency}
  value={convertedCurrencyValue}
/>
```

![pwd](./assets/intro.gif)

We used a new datatype of `Intl.NumberFormat` to help us get the correct formatting. We did so by creating a new component `FormattedCurrency` which took two props `type` & `value`. In the body of the component definition we used these `props` to get our component to render accordingly.

Everything should be working now. Excellent!

---

> **Key Points** üîëüìù

- Adding state to our application adds dynamic behavior. We can change the state of the application by using state. In this case we changed the state of which currency the user wants to convert `from` & `to`.

- Our components can be composed of many smaller functions which help us to branch behavior. Consider the `convertCurrency` & `setConversionCurrencies` functions we defined within the body of the `App` component.

---

## Review üíªü§ìü§î

- All components require some properties. The properties will be of many different shapes, many different data types üçöü•¶üçóüå∂.

- We can build üèóüë∑our own components to take props **easily**. These props will influence our component's behavior. Some of the props we passed were:
  - `to="vnd"`
  - `from="usd"`
  - `toCurrency={toCurrency}`
  - `fromCurrency={fromCurrency}`
  - `setConversionCurrencies={setConversionCurrencies}`
  - `type={fromCurrency}`
  - `value={currentCurrencyValue}`

- We can add state to our application if we're familiar with `useState`.
  - `useState` is a function.
  - The return value is an array
  - `useState('Hello World')` would result in `'Hello World'` being the default state.
  - The first index is the state variable.
  - The second is known as a `setter` function/method.
- `useEffect()` is used to apply state changes.
  - In other words, run this code after state has changed.
